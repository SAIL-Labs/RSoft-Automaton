Added Mode-Selective feature. Can select individual core numbers to optimize parameters to best enhance mode selectivity.

Added separate test metric specifically for mode-selective optimisation; takes the average of the last 10 monitor values for the chosen core.

Cleaned up section using the function overwrite_template_val() where values within simulation_val overwrite parameters in template file.

Added option to not run optimisation and only run a single BeamPROP simulation using template/overwritten values.

Fixed bug where for long simulations RSoft will prevent BeamPROP from completing a simulation due to constant refreshing of plots by disabling in-simulation plotting.

Added check for taper length to raise an exception if it isnt' defined in template.py properly.

Fixed bug where multimode source was not randomising the launch field by adding a random integer pulled between (0, 100).

--WIP--
Added function to calculate the maximum and minimum diameter to support the number of modes equal to the number of cores.
