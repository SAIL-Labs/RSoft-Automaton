Added function to log each iteration of parameters into a csv file.

Added a separate function in the Jupyter notebook to plot the parameters and their throughputs to remove the need to save each batch completion as their separate image.

Added support for running a singular BeamPROP simulation as a proxy for initial guesses prior to running the optimization loop.
