Added function to calculate the maximum and minimum diameter to support the number of modes equal to the number of cores. Generates image showing max/min diameters for a range of wavelengths and the modes supported within.

Wrote function to assign core properties before dumping simulation_val as a json.

Bug fixes:
- every core diameter was being assigned the template value in template.py instead of the fixed value in Data_manip.ipynb. This made the mode_selective feature redundant as ever core held the same core diam and delta n
	Now only the mode selective core is assigned the custom values whereas other cores have fixed values
